      <p>
        This course has taught me the most important concepts in javaScript and it 
        also had many intersting and engaging projects to build. The course was structured
        in a way that makes it easy to follow and the instructor made sure to explain every 
        concept in details which makes this course a good choice for both beginners and experienced
        developers. The course starts with the very basics of programing like the classic "hello world"
        program, data structures, arrays, operators and so on followed by more advanced topics like DOM, events 
        Asynchronus javaScript, OOP and ES6+ syntax.
      </p>
      <p>
         I think that the best way to learn a programming language is by practicing and writing code after each 
        concept that you learnt, and this course makes sure to include many side projects and big projects as well
        that you can develop. Every time a new project was presented i took my time to code it by myself and try to 
        reproduce the look and feel of the project as best as i could. After that i could compare the code that i had 
        to the one that Jonas wrote. This way i could see 2 different approaches of writing code and picked the good
        habbits and applied them further. 
      </p>
      <p>
         Two projects that caught my attention were: <strong>The pig game</strong>and <strong>Forkify app. </strong>I picked the idea that Jonas gave me for this 2 applications and created my own applications with all the knowledge that 
        i had gathered at that point in time and also modified the applications' design and functionality.
      </p>
      <!-- The pig game-->

      <p>The changes that i brought to this projects:
        <ul>
          <li>The javaScript code for all the functionalities has been changed </li>
          <li>The second player is now played by computer (no second human player needed) </li>
          <li>When the computer is playing a message is shown on top of the game board</li>
          <li>The icons and the design is slightly changed</li>
        </ul>

      <!--Conclusion-->
      <h2>Conclusions </h2>
      <p>
        While this course has many things to offer and it is a good start for those who are completely new to programming or they already have some programming experience and want 
        to learn javaScript, the only way you can get the best of this course is by building all the 
        projects from scratch and then compare your result to Jona's result. This is the approach i have 
        with all the courses that i take and so far it has paid off.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would give this course a 5/5 rating and recommend it to anyone that want to learn javaScript or they want to consolidate the knowledge they have.</p>
      <p>
        At the end of the course, if you complete all the steps, you will be rewarded with a certification (as with every course on udemy)</p><img src="./images/foodie-mine.png" alt="certification screenshot"/>
